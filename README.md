This exercise consists of 2 different parts:
1. draw the recursion tree of fib(5) (similar to what we did in class)

2. Choose at least 2 new recursive methods which we have not discussed in class. 
You can come up with an own or of course you can use the web for help.
The size of the methods can be arbitrary. It can also be famous ones such as MergeSort, BinarySearch, ...
Besides the code, also submit a recursion tree.
Please upload the pictures in an own folder in your project (not in the src folder)
